# -Population-Birth-and-Death-Analysis-Bangladesh-
This project analyzes birth and death records in Bangladesh over the last 4 months (February to May 2025) to study population trends. Using Python, we explore how the birth and death rates affect overall population growth during this period.

# 🎯 Key Features

Net population change calculation

Graphical visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

Clean, readable Python code with comments

Well-structured folders for code, data, and output

# 📌 Dataset Info
The dataset includes:

Monthly birth count

Monthly death count

Net change (births - deaths)

If real data isn't available, a simulated dataset is used for demonstration.

📈 Sample Insights (Example)
📅 Highest birth month: March 2025

# ⚰️ Highest death month: April 2025

📈 Total population growth: +35,000 (estimated)
